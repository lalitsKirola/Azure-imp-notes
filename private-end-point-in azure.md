Let’s go through a detailed example of setting up a private endpoint for a storage account, focusing on DNS zones and record sets in Azure.

### Scenario
You have:
1. **Storage Account**: `mystorageaccount` initially accessible via the public endpoint `mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net`.
2. **Virtual Machine (VM)**: Located in the VNet `myVNet` within the same region as the storage account.
3. **Goal**: Transition the storage account from public access to private access through a private endpoint.

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Access with Public IP
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The storage account is configured with a public IP.
   - The VM in `myVNet` can resolve the storage account’s public DNS name `mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net`.
2. **Public DNS Resolution**:
   - When the VM attempts to upload a file to the storage account, it queries DNS for `mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net`.
   - This query resolves to the public IP of the storage account, and the connection is established over the internet.

#### Step 2: Disable Public IP and Create Private Endpoint
1. **Disabling the Public IP**:
   - You disable public access for the storage account, so it no longer has a publicly routable IP. Now, connections must use a private IP within the Azure network.
2. **Creating a Private Endpoint**:
   - You create a private endpoint for `mystorageaccount` in `myVNet`. During creation, Azure:
     - Provisions a private IP address from your VNet’s address space (say `10.0.1.5`) and assigns it to a **network interface (NIC)** associated with this endpoint.
     - Links the private endpoint’s NIC to the storage account, so `mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net` can now be accessed via `10.0.1.5` from within the VNet.

#### Step 3: DNS Configuration and Private DNS Zone Creation
1. **DNS Zone Creation**:
   - Azure automatically creates a **Private DNS Zone** named `privatelink.blob.core.windows.net` in your DNS settings.
   - This zone is automatically linked to your VNet, which allows Azure’s DNS resolver to respond with private IPs when resources within `myVNet` try to resolve the storage account’s name.
2. **DNS Record Set**:
   - Inside the `privatelink.blob.core.windows.net` DNS zone, Azure adds an **`A` record** for `mystorageaccount`. The record is as follows:
     - **Name**: `mystorageaccount` (the storage account’s name)
     - **Type**: `A` record
     - **IP Address**: `10.0.1.5` (private IP assigned to the NIC)
   - With this record, any DNS request within `myVNet` for `mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net` is redirected to `10.0.1.5`.

#### Step 4: Accessing the Storage Account through the Private Endpoint
1. **DNS Query Resolution**:
   - Now, when the VM tries to access `mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net`, the following happens:
     - The VM’s DNS resolver checks the `privatelink.blob.core.windows.net` private DNS zone.
     - It finds the `A` record pointing `mystorageaccount` to `10.0.1.5`.
     - The DNS resolver returns `10.0.1.5` to the VM, allowing it to connect to the storage account’s private IP.
2. **Secure Connectivity**:
   - The connection between the VM and the storage account is now entirely private, isolated within `myVNet`, and does not leave Azure’s internal network. There is no internet-based access since public IP access was disabled.

### Summary Table of DNS Resolution Changes

| Step              | DNS Zone                          | DNS Record                         | Resolved IP    |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------|
| Public Access     | Public DNS                        | `mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net` | Public IP     |
| Private Endpoint  | Private DNS (`privatelink.blob.core.windows.net`) | `mystorageaccount` `A` record     | 10.0.1.5 (Private IP) |

### Key Points on DNS Zones and Record Sets

- **Private DNS Zone (`privatelink.blob.core.windows.net`)**: This zone is dedicated to handling private DNS resolution for Azure storage accounts with private endpoints.
- **`A` Record for `mystorageaccount`**: The record set within this zone maps the storage account’s hostname to the NIC’s private IP.
- **Automatic DNS Update**: When creating a private endpoint, Azure handles DNS zone and record setup automatically, simplifying access within the VNet.

This setup ensures that DNS queries from your VNet resolve to a private IP, providing secure and internal-only access to your storage account.
